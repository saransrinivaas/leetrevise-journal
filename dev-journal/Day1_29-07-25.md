## Day 1 – Thoughts vs Noise

It’s been a while since this idea struck me: a website with a LeetCode extension that brings **spaced repetition** to coding problems.

See, I’ve always found it hard to track what I’ve solved, what I’ve forgotten, and what needs revisiting. And revision? It’s crucial. **Active learning demands it.** While I know I’m not the first to think this, and platforms *do* exist, I believe there’s still room to do it better. Cleaner. Smarter. More aligned with the real struggles of learners like me.

This whole thing feels like a natural **extension to LeetCode**—not just another tracker or another daily problem reminder. I'm thinking:

* A **streak system** not just for solving “Problem of the Day” but for staying consistent.
* A way to **reward consistency over brute-force mastery**, because let’s face it: mastery is a byproduct of consistency.

And if you ask *why this idea*, why not something else?
Simple: It felt *right*. It filled a gap I’ve personally struggled with.
But not every thought is worth chasing—I’ve learned that the hard way.
So here I am, committing to being **mindful**, not just enthusiastic. That’s part of why I’m writing this.

Today, I watched a video about **"signal vs noise."**
It hit me. If you want to get anything meaningful done, your head’s gotta be filled with more *signal* than *noise*.
But noise isn’t all bad—it’s the birthplace of creativity, of lateral thinking.
Still, when the clock's ticking?

> "You’ve gotta get your shit done."
> And that’s exactly what I’m committing to.

Let’s build something that matters.

*Keep the vibe up,*
**Saran**
